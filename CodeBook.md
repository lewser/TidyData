#####Variable 01          
    subject      
      Description: subject is an integer with a range from 1 to 30 used to represent one of the 30 subjects  
      in the study.  
      
      Data Prep Note: subject was taken from one of two separate text files and combined with the larger data  
      set via the cbind() function. Used in combination with the activity field to determine the subset used  
      to generate the aggregate mean value for each of the 66 variables (#03-#68) representing a mean value  
      or standard deviation recording.
      
#####Variable 02          
    activity          
      Description: activity is a character string used to represent one of the six activities (e.g. 'Walking')     
      in the study.  
      
      Data Prep Note: activity was taken from one of two separate text files and combined with the larger data  
      set via the cbind() function. Used in combination with the subject field to determine the subset used  
      to generate the aggregate mean value for each of the 66 variables (#03-#68) representing a mean value  
      or standard deviation recording.  
      
#####Variable 03          
    Time_BodyAcc_Mean_X            
      Description: Time_BodyAcc_Mean_X is an integer used to represent the *average* mean value of the time signal  
      representing the body acceleration signal for the X direction.  
      
      Data Prep Note: represents an aggregate average value based on dozens of observations. The individual  
      observations are still located in the fp_x_combination data set generated by the run_analysis.R script.  
      
#####Variable 04          
    Time_BodyAcc_Mean_Y            
      Description: Time_BodyAcc_Mean_Y is an integer used to represent the *average* mean value of the time signal  
      representing the body acceleration signal for the Y direction.  
      
      Data Prep Note: represents an aggregate average value based on dozens of observations. The individual  
      observations are still located in the fp_x_combination data set generated by the run_analysis.R script.  
      
#####Variable 05          
    Time_BodyAcc_Mean_Z            
      Description: Time_BodyAcc_Mean_Z is an integer used to represent the *average* mean value of the time signal  
      representing the body acceleration signal for the Z direction.  
      
      Data Prep Note: represents an aggregate average value based on dozens of observations. The individual  
      observations are still located in the fp_x_combination data set generated by the run_analysis.R script.   
      
#####Variable 06          
    Time_BodyAcc_STD_X            
      Description: Time_BodyAcc_STD_X is an integer used to represent the *average* statistical deviation of  
      the time signal representing the body acceleration signal for the X direction.  
      
      Data Prep Note: represents an aggregate average value based on dozens of observations. The individual  
      observations are still located in the fp_x_combination data set generated by the run_analysis.R script.  
      
#####Variable 07          
    Time_BodyAcc_STD_Y            
      Description: Time_BodyAcc_STD_Y is an integer used to represent the *average* statistical deviation of   
      the time signal representing the body acceleration signal for the Y direction.  
      
      Data Prep Note: represents an aggregate average value based on dozens of observations. The individual  
      observations are still located in the fp_x_combination data set generated by the run_analysis.R script.  
      
#####Variable 08          
    Time_BodyAcc_STD_Z            
      Description: Time_BodyAcc_STD_Z is an integer used to represent the *average* statistical deviation of  
      the time signal representing the body acceleration signal for the Z direction.  
      
      Data Prep Note: represents an aggregate average value based on dozens of observations. The individual  
      observations are still located in the fp_x_combination data set generated by the run_analysis.R script.
